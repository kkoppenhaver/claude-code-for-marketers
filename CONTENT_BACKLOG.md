  **On "vibe coding" with Claude Code:**
  > "The concept they land on is 'vibe coding': you describe what you want, an AI builds it, and you iterate until it feels right. It's not just code; it's not just music—it's the idea that you don't need a full-blown team of specialists to create something unique. If you can describe the vibe, the AI can help you realize it."

  **On building a bio-to-Notion tool:**
  > "The storyteller even built an app with Claude code to upload biographies, convert them into Notion-ready content... measuring and documenting a person's common garment dimensions... and uploading that data to a system that can recommend sizes from various brands."

  **On AI as personalization engine:**
  > "Sam and the other host hammer on: AI as a mass personalization engine... software is moving away from a one-size-fits-all model toward deeply personal tools that scale to you."
