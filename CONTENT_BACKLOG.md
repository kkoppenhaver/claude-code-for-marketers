### How to create a brand guide for a website using Claude Code and the DevTools MCP
- **Status:** `idea`
- **Type:** Tutorial/quick win
- **Angle:** Inspect live site CSS → extract brand system → auto-generate documentation
- **Notes:** The DevTools MCP angle lets readers grab real color values, font stacks, and spacing from any site without manual inspection. Good for documenting their own brand or reverse-engineering competitors.
