# Content Backlog — Claude Code for Marketers

Ideas, planned posts, and in-progress content. Ordered by priority.

## Backlog

### 3. Claude Code vs. Lovable vs. Cursor vs. Bolt: a marketer's decision guide
- **Status:** `briefed`
- **Priority:** High (acquisition)
- **Category:** Tips and Techniques
- **Target keyword:** *Claude Code vs Lovable vs Cursor non-developers*
- **Angle:** Build a comparison matrix for non-technical marketers: what each tool is best at, learning curve, cost, when to pick one over another. "If you want a landing page in 10 minutes, use Lovable. If you want a reusable workflow that runs every week, use Claude Code."
- **Why now:** Every existing comparison is dev-focused. This would be the only marketer-focused guide.

### 4. The CLAUDE.md masterclass: how to teach Claude your brand voice once and never repeat yourself
- **Status:** `briefed`
- **Priority:** High (retention + lead magnet)
- **Category:** Tips and Techniques
- **Target keyword:** *CLAUDE.md brand voice guide, Claude Code brand guidelines*
- **Angle:** The definitive standalone guide. Show exactly what to put in it (brand voice, preferred formats, project context, anti-patterns), how to evolve it over time, and provide downloadable templates for different marketing roles.
- **Why now:** CLAUDE.md is the #1 power-user feature non-technical users don't know about. A downloadable template pack doubles as a secondary lead magnet.
- **Bonus:** Create a "Marketer's CLAUDE.md Template Pack" (content marketer, agency owner, email marketer, social media manager versions) as a downloadable lead magnet embedded in this post.

### 5. Build your first landing page with Claude Code in 20 minutes
- **Status:** `briefed`
- **Priority:** High (shareable)
- **Category:** Use Cases
- **Target keyword:** *Claude Code landing page tutorial, build landing page AI*
- **Angle:** Walk through describing what you want, Claude building it, iterating in the browser, deploying it. Keep it simpler than Boring Marketer's 2-part technical series. Emphasize the feedback loop: "Change the headline. Make the button bigger. Add a testimonial section." All in plain English.
- **Why now:** Landing pages are the most tangible, exciting thing non-technical marketers can build. Everyone else's tutorial is too technical.

### 6. I built a client-ready lead magnet calculator in 30 minutes. Here's how.
- **Status:** `briefed`
- **Priority:** Medium (aspirational use case)
- **Category:** Use Cases
- **Target keyword:** *build lead magnet Claude Code, interactive calculator AI*
- **Angle:** Agency owners dream of offering interactive tools (ROI calculators, audit scorecards, quizzes) but can't justify dev time. Walk through building one from description to working prototype. Include the before (hours of back-and-forth with a dev) and after (30 minutes in Claude Code).
- **Why now:** Lead magnet creation is a top-requested use case from agency owners. Highly shareable.

### 7. How to build a weekly marketing dashboard that writes itself
- **Status:** `briefed`
- **Priority:** Medium (aspirational use case)
- **Category:** Use Cases
- **Target keyword:** *Claude Code marketing dashboard, automated reporting*
- **Angle:** Pull from Google Analytics, email platform, and social metrics into a single auto-generating report. Show the exact prompts and file structure. Emphasize the time savings: "Every Monday morning, this runs and my team has the numbers before standup."
- **Why now:** Zero tutorial content exists for this. Reporting is a universal pain point.

### 8. How one marketer built a Google Ads workflow that creates campaigns in 30 seconds
- **Status:** `briefed`
- **Priority:** Medium (deeper workflow)
- **Category:** Use Cases
- **Target keyword:** *Claude Code Google Ads automation*
- **Angle:** Adapt/reference the Austin Lau (Anthropic) case study where ad creation went from 30 minutes to 30 seconds. Add beginner-friendly framing and step-by-step recreation instructions.
- **Why now:** Stormy AI has the only existing content on this, and it's extremely technical. A marketer-friendly version would own this space.

### 9. SEO on autopilot: using Claude Code to audit, optimize, and monitor your content
- **Status:** `briefed`
- **Priority:** Medium (deeper workflow)
- **Category:** Use Cases
- **Target keyword:** *Claude Code SEO automation, AI SEO audit*
- **Angle:** Walk through three SEO workflows: (1) content audit of existing pages, (2) keyword gap analysis vs. competitors, (3) automated monitoring for ranking changes. Reference Firecrawl's approach but make it accessible for someone who's never used Ahrefs.
- **Why now:** SEO automation is a hot topic but existing content assumes technical SEO knowledge.

### 10. The solo marketer's AI stack: how to do the work of 10 people
- **Status:** `briefed`
- **Priority:** Medium (deeper workflow)
- **Category:** Tips and Techniques
- **Target keyword:** *AI marketing stack 2026, one-person marketing team AI*
- **Angle:** Aspirational "north star" post. Claude Code as the orchestrator + the best skills to install + MCP servers for your marketing integrations + complementary tools (Obsidian, Typefully, Kit, etc.). Taps into the dominant X narrative about replacing entire teams. Link heavily to existing posts as the how-to guides for each piece.
- **Why now:** High aspiration, high share potential. Perfect LinkedIn content.

### 11. 7 Claude Code skills every marketer should install this week
- **Status:** `briefed`
- **Priority:** Medium (community building)
- **Category:** Getting Started
- **Target keyword:** *best Claude Code skills marketing, Claude Code skills install*
- **Angle:** Curate the best marketing-specific skills from across the ecosystem (Corey Haines' repo, Boring Marketer's, emailmarketingskill.com, cc-skills repo, Anthropic's built-in frontend-design) with plain-English explanations and install instructions. Position this as the "app store guide" for marketing skills.
- **Why now:** The skills ecosystem is exploding but most marketers don't know what to install or where to find them.

### 12. What I got wrong about Claude Code in my first two months (and what changed everything)
- **Status:** `briefed`
- **Priority:** Medium (trust builder)
- **Category:** Tips and Techniques
- **Target keyword:** *Claude Code mistakes, learning Claude Code*
- **Angle:** Authentic reflection. Share real mistakes: prompts that didn't work, skills that broke, times you burned credits unnecessarily, the mental model shifts that unlocked better output. Position the 7-day email course as the "skip the mistakes" shortcut.
- **Why now:** Vulnerability content drives the strongest email signups. This is the trust builder post.

### 13. The non-technical marketer's Claude Code FAQ: 15 questions answered honestly
- **Status:** `briefed`
- **Priority:** Medium (evergreen resource)
- **Category:** Getting Started
- **Target keyword:** *Claude Code FAQ non-developers*
- **Angle:** Consolidate every question from Reddit, X, YouTube, and email replies into one definitive resource. Include honest answers about limitations, costs, and the learning curve. Be the adult in the room: "No, Claude Code won't replace your entire marketing team. Here's what it actually can and can't do."
- **Why now:** Evergreen, updatable monthly, strong SEO foundation. Becomes the page you link to when anyone asks "should I learn Claude Code?"
