# Strategic Actions — Claude Code for Marketers

Non-content tasks to improve site growth, trust, and discoverability.

## Done

- [x] **Publish an About page** — Background (CTO at Alpha Particle, Developer Advocate, DevRel Lead at Retool + FloorboardAI consultant) is the single most compelling trust signal. Include a photo.
- [x] **Add RSS feed** — Enables syndication and subscriber tooling.

## This week

- [ ] **Add social proof** — Even "Join 200+ marketers learning Claude Code" or a single testimonial from an email course subscriber would improve conversion. If you have email replies praising the course, ask permission to quote them.
- [ ] **Tighten internal linking** — "Keep Learning" sections are good but inconsistent. Every new post should link to 2-3 existing posts. Retroactively add links where they're missing (e.g., the CLAUDE.md deep-dive should link to the Tricks post and Obsidian post).

## This month

- [ ] **Prioritize comparison posts for SEO** — Posts 1, 3 from the content backlog (vs. ChatGPT, vs. Lovable/Cursor/Bolt) are the highest-leverage acquisition pieces. They target search queries with zero quality results. Publish these first and promote heavily.
- [ ] **Create the CLAUDE.md Template Pack** — Second lead magnet beyond the 7-day course. Offer it as a download in the CLAUDE.md Masterclass post (backlog #4) and on any CLAUDE.md-related content. Templates for: content marketer, agency owner, email marketer, social media manager.
- [ ] **Cross-post to LinkedIn** — Target audience lives there. Adapt best posts (especially content repurposing and solo marketer stack) into LinkedIn articles and carousels.
- [ ] **Add a Resources/Tools page** — Curate MCP servers, skills repos, courses, and communities for marketing-focused Claude Code users. Becomes a linkable asset other sites reference, and a natural home for affiliate links down the road.

## Longer-term

- [ ] **Consider video** — Sabrina Ramonov's YouTube tutorials are getting massive engagement. Existing posts are perfectly structured for "code-along" screen recordings. Even short (5-min) Loom-style videos embedded in posts would differentiate from text-only competitors.
- [ ] **Guest post on high-authority platforms** — Every.to, Lenny's, and Animalz have all published Claude Code content. A guest post from the creator of CC4M would drive targeted traffic and backlinks.
- [ ] **Address cc4.marketing brand confusion** — Another creator runs "Claude Code for Marketers" at cc4.marketing with a full interactive course. Consider whether collaboration (mutual linking, guest content) or differentiation (emphasizing ongoing blog/newsletter vs. their one-time course) is the better strategy.
